# videoprocessing-android-java
Apply a face filter on a video loaded from gallery using DeepAR SDK.

This example implements a video decoder and encoder. The decoded video frames are fed into DeepAR
for processing. The processed frames are fed into the encoder and the resulting video is written to
a file.

To run the example
* Go to https://developer.deepar.ai, sign up, create the project and the Android app, copy the license key and paste it to VideoProcessor.java (instead of your_license_key_goes_here string)
* Download the SDK from https://developer.deepar.ai and copy the deepar.aar into videoprocessing-android-java/deepar folder
