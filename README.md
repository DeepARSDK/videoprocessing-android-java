How to apply face filter on a video loaded from gallery using DeepAR SDK

This example implements a video decoder. The video frames are then fed into DeepAR for processing and display.
If you need to save the resulting video, __you will need to implement your own encoder using the frames from frameAvailable__.

To run the example
* Go to https://developer.deepar.ai, sign up, create the project and the Android app, copy the license key and paste it to MainActivity.java (instead of your_license_key_goes_here string)
* Download the SDK from https://developer.deepar.ai and copy the deepar.aar into videoprocessing-android-java/deepar folder
